        I would like to be a software engineer. I hope to work at a company like Google or Microsoft
         preferably, and I also hope that I can work remotely as I would rather stay home where I am 
         most comfortable.
    </p>
    <p style="max-width: 600px; margin: 10px auto; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; margin-top: 10px;">
        If trying to become a software engineer doesn't work out for me in the future, I might revert
         to my old plan and become a web developer instead, that way I will still get a job in something 
         I am interested in doing.
    </p>
    
    <div class="Title2">
    <h2 style="max-width: 600px; margin: 20px auto;">College Plans</h2>
    </div>
    
    <p style="max-width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; margin-top: 10px;">
        I think I won't go to college, but instead I will try looking for work instead. I am not sure if going to college 
        is still worth going to for learning computer science, as employers might value my skills more than a degree, and
         I already go to SVCTE, so I might be covered already for a job, and college isn't really for me, I would rather 
         just learn how to do a job, than have to learn other subjects along with it.
    </p>

    <p style="max-width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; margin-top: 10px;">
        I am thinking of applying or getting an intership if necessary for a software engineer or web developer job somewhere in 
        the future instead of applying for college, and I do hope to get one and get the job in the end.
